# Simulation modeling and optimization.

Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of several credit instruments is modeled based on their migration probabilities. Develop effective portfolio trading strategies. 

Monte-Carlo Simulation for factor model (structural model) is generated for 100,000 out-sample (true) scenarios. The performance is compared to in-sample (assumed) distribution to mitigate risk and loss.

Model error, sample error and it's effects on falsly assuming a normal distribution is observed.
